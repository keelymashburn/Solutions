Question:

Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

Answer:

S size is m;

	max = undefined
	for i from 0 to m-1
		if(max is undefined or max < T[(h(k) + i) mod m]
		max = T[(h(k) + i) mod m]
		

The Worst Case is O(m)
